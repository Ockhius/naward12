####Idea 
If you consider a categorization by assigning specific words to a interest/category, 
you can find out which interests are associated with which words, or so called queries? 
Is this a suitable idea to work on? Because it sounds basic but it can provide important knowledge about the web 
for developers, and also to try to become higher in the google-ranking 
for example by adding those 'key' words on their website to attract specific groups of people?


####method
The method we are going to adopt in this project consists of the following steps:

-Defining a categorisation-list of specific interests

-Analysing the words which contain different meaning, interprete them and put them in the right category

-Remove duplicate, synonyms and other irrelavant words


####Results
Description of results: lots of data in form of textfiles which are dericed from the common web crawl.

####Discussion: 
Interpetation of the results is redundant to differences into the meaning of words, but at the same time
the text contains errors so only fully correct pronounced words will be interpreted and categorised
